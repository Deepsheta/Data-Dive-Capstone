# Housing Crisis Fiction or Fact?
## Project Summary

•	In order to close the gap between perception and fact, I oversaw a thorough investigation of the Canadian housing market as the principal investigator for the "Housing Crisis in Canada: Fact or Fiction?" project. 
•	Our project provides a perceptive and accurate representation of the difficulties encountered by people and communities across the country by carefully examining historical processes and significant factors to the crisis. As part of my work, I also had to translate difficult information into easily understood visual representations for a wide audience. By forecasting the housing market's course for 2023–2024, I helped to take a forward-looking strategy and helped stakeholders, decision-makers, and the general public navigate changing dynamics.

## Objective & Goals:

The primary objective of our project “Housing Crisis in Canada: Friction or Fact? " Is to critically assess
the housing crisis in Canada, differentiating between perceived notions and the actual impact. We aim
to investigate whether the housing crisis is substantiated by empirical evidence or if it has been
amplified by selective media coverage and influential figures. By conducting a rigorous analysis, we seek
to provide a well-rounded understanding of this issue, shedding light on its root causes, extent, and
implications for Canadians.
