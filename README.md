# Housing Crisis Fiction or Fact?

## Objective & Goals:

The primary objective of our project â€œHousing Crisis in Canada: Friction or Fact? " Is to critically assess
the housing crisis in Canada, differentiating between perceived notions and the actual impact. We aim
to investigate whether the housing crisis is substantiated by empirical evidence or if it has been
amplified by selective media coverage and influential figures. By conducting a rigorous analysis, we seek
to provide a well-rounded understanding of this issue, shedding light on its root causes, extent, and
implications for Canadians.
